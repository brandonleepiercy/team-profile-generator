## Description

This repository contains a set of js files which help the user automatically generate an html page displaying the team members within a work group, based on user inputs into an 'inquirer' CLI. The user can select whether to add an employee, manager, engineer, or intern, and each specific class has unique attributes whichcomprise the sections of html which will be displayed on the generated page. After the inquirer is run, an html page is generated in the 'output' folder containing a representation of the data that a user has entered.
